10.25 Update

I created a project proposal which outlines what I want my project to be. I created the project shiny app. I created my list of questions thus far. 

Project Proposal:
Create shiny app for my interaction of mental health and positionality in literature project. The user should start with a title page which more goes through the overview of the project and the research. Then, I want there to be three different user interfaces depending on what version of positionality the user wishes to look at (author, protagonist, race alone or gender alone). Then on the chosen interface the user can create various visualizations. 

I have two ideas for the purpose of this app. First, this can help me explore the data and filter through the various visualizations and try to find patterns. 
But then I also want it to go with my published paper in terms of being able to convey my findings, so perhaps I can give hints of "try this combination" and have an analysis / findings from that visual.

Questions:
Can I create a shiny app where it draws from multiple different .rmd files? Because each positionality combination is on its own file. Or should I just transfer the various code into the singular shiny app file?

10.28 Update

Basic visuals I want included in the app: 
(There will be a primary visual showing the measurement for each positionality. Underneath, I want a comparison visual for the mental health novels and parallel novels; I will gather YA novels, one by the same author for each novel in my mh group). So user chooses how they want to define positionality. Then chooses which of the following measurements they want to visualize. (if having choice of all visuals is too overwhelming, I could break into catergory; ie text analysis, sentiment analysis, mh-specific analysis, topic modeling) 
- Top 10 most common words used per positionality bargraph
- Single sent percentage based of words per book, swarm plot w/ mean
- Nrc emotion percentages -> maybe with heat map instead of faceted?
- Percentage of MH terms out of total words in novel, swarm plot w/ mean
- Frequency of Derog mh words out of all words, swarm plot w/ mean
- Non derog / derog percentage ratio, swarm plot w/ mean
- Sentiment +-10 around mh words, swarm plot w/ mean
- Most common MH words
- Sentiment Analysis Graph (could just have all novels or user chooses a novel to look at, but this visual doesn't tell us much, so idk if I want to include just to have this app as a collection of all that I have created to analyze mh portrayal, or scrap this method).

Topic Modeling interactive app:
Slider to choose number of topics. 
Another slider to decide how many topics to display in the visualization (ie top 5 most relevent).
- Top words per topic, one visual per positionality
- intertopic distance map. So all novels divided into topics. Then do the gamma calculation to assign each book its top lets say 5 topics and then label topic with the positionalities associated w/ it. INTERACTIVE GRAPH? Make it so when you click a topic's bubble it selects that topic to create the visual next to it -- a bargraph with the top 30 terms associated with that topic (and gives 'percent of tokens' ie how prevalent that topic is).

Long Term To Do List:
- Collect non mh books and clean. 
- Pretty up my current visuals (titles, labels, captions, etc).
- Create new visuals.
- Figure out shiny app implementation.
- Figure out Topic Modeling stuff.

To Decide: Maybe eliminate on of the positionality by author or protag, depending where we see results. Thus making gender align with that decision. Orrr make gender only include novels where gender of author = gender of protag.

Questions:
I used navbarPage, but I'm not sure how this can integrate with the usual shinyapp structure we learned.

11.1 Update

Only have project overview, positionality of author, p of protag. Then within 2 options, can choose an option that'll make it just race or just gender.

No more non-mh books. Too many confounding factors. I tried w/ books by the same author, but found that even tho the main topic wasn't mh, there was mh present. It is an author topic of interest. But not same author would change genre and other factors too much.

11.4 Update

In Progress:
- Pretty up my current visuals (titles, labels, captions, etc).
- Create new visuals.
- Figure out shiny app implementation.
-> use tabset panel. get static visuals in app. do all data wrangling, write to csv file. then at top of shiny app import in
- Figure out Topic Modeling stuff.

11.8 Update

I set up the layout of my app. I put in the inputs I will eventually be connecting and output placeholders. I created all the data, doing the text wrangling in one rmd, creating csvs, and then upload the csvs to the shiny file.

Note when choosing race only that race of author always aligns with race of protag, so the two tabs should have completely paralleled content.

idea: do lemmatization and full words versions.

HELP!! GITHUB WONT LET ME UPLOAD DUE TO FILE SIZE?!

11.11 Update

Collected the static visuals. Figured out text output for overview.
